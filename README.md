# Frontend Engineering: Best Practices, Checklists, Guidelines, Principles etc

I have created this document - to serve as a central referencing place for principles, practices and information related to frontend engineering.

My motivation for creating this is to have a central place of a collection of what I need to keep my mind on when working on projects. My brain works well with such a format - if anything, that was my main incentive. I decided to open it up in case it helps anyone else. 

The information is generic and framework agnostic, meaning that it is applicable to a wide range of projects and not tied to any specific framework.
Enjoy!

Note: This is a living document and will continue to be edited. All relevant resources and sources are included.
